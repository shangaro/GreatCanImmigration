    "description":"The factors that play a role in this program are skilled trade work experience, education, language ability, proof of funds, admissibility, and assessment of trade by the province or territory.For education, there is no formal education requirement. But itâ€™s always better to have education to rank higher among the candidates in Express Entry pool.For language ability, a candidate should have a minimum of CLB 5 in speaking and listening, and CLB 4 in reading and writing.For proof of funds, a candidate must proof that they have enough funds to settle themselves and their family members (if applicable) in Canada. This could be waved only if they are currently legally working in Canada or they secured a valid job offer with LMIA (if applicable) from an employer in Canada.The assessment of trades is normally done by the province or territory. A candidate may also require an employer in Canada to give experience and training.Kindly call us for one-one consultation to see if you are eligible to apply in Express Entry through Federal Skilled Trade Program."
